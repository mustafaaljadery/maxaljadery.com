# Designing Systems

## How to approach questions
1. Clarify the problem, get as much detail as you can from your interviewer. 
2. Propose the functional requirements, and non-functional requirements of the app. 
3. High level design of the system and get buy-in from the interviewer. 
4. Dive into the details of the system, and start designing the components.
5. Identify and resolve bottlenecks, tradeoffs, and summarize.
