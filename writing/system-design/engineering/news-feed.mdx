# Design Newsfeed System

A constantly updating list of news articles, posts, or updates from various sources or users on a website or app.


## Functional Requirements
- Users can post items and have them displayed on the other person's timeline.

## Non-functional Requirements
- The system should be highly available. 
- The system should be highly consistent.
- The system should scale with a large number of users creating and consuming content.

## Envelope Estimation
- **QPS**: 1M
- **DAU**: 1M
- **Storage**: 1M * 1KB = 1GB/day
- **Bandwidth**: 1M * 1KB = 1GB/day
