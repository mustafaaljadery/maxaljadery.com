# Design a Unique ID Generator

## Functional Requirements
- Generate a unique ID
- ID has to be 64 bits

## Non-Functional Requirements
- ID has to be unique

## Estimations
- We are going to be generating a 10,000 ids per second.
- 10,000 * 60 * 60 * 24 = 864,000,000 ids per day

## Design

### UUID
- We can generate a UUID. A UUID is a 128-bit id that is used for unique identification. I combines both a timestamp and a mac address. This way it ensure uniqueness.
- The pros are that UUIDS are very easy to generate. They are also very unique.

### Twitter Snowflake
- An approach that combines a timestamp, a machine id, and a sequence number. This way we can ensure that the id is unique.
- The uniqueness of this design depends on the uniqueness of the datacenter ID and the machine ID. 
- It's a great approach for the 64 bits limit.

## Tradeoffs, Bottlenecks, Summary

### Tradeoffs
- UUIDs are great because they are really easy to make. However, they are twice the size of the 64 bit requirement.

### Bottlenecks
- There really aren't that many when it comes to uniqueness. 

### Summary
In order to get a unique id, we can use a UUID or generate an id using Twitter Snowflake.
